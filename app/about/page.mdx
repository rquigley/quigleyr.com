I&rsquo;m a software engineer and entrepreneur. I&rsquo;ve been building software for over 20 years and have been involved in a wide range of projects and organizations, including co-founding three startups. With a background in computer science and design, my expertise and passion lies at the intersection of technology and user experience. My approach to technology is deeply rooted in a user-centric philosophy.

Most recently I co-founded [AuditRe](https://auditre.co) in 2023, a platform built for financial advisory service firms and their clients. Our premise is that audited financials can be delivered for review in a fraction of the cost and time. I architected and developed the system, leveraging applied-AI to automate many of the processes.

In 2015 I co-founded SimpleHealth, a nation-wide healthcare business focused on providing telehealth services for reproductive health. At SimpleHealth, I leveraged a user-focused approach to develop a platform that simplified the complexity of healthcare interactions for patients and providers alike while retaining the ability for providers to deal with complex issues in an efficient manner.

I joined Keep.com in 2012 as a software engineer. Keep was a social shopping platform that allowed users to save, share, and purchase products they loved. My initial role focused on front-end performance engineering, ops, and product crawling teams, and in 2013 I was promoted to lead engineering.

In addition to my technical skills, I strive to strategically build teams with capabilities beyond those of traditional cross-functional orgs, fostering a culture of innovation and maintainability. Just as important, I work to foster an environment where my teammates are able to learn and thrive.

## Technical contributions

- I created a testing framework for evaluating LLM models and optimizing prompts for usage within an organization/system (AuditRe, Typescript, OpenAI, Claude).
- Created tools for LLMs to reduce costs and improve performance and reliability (AuditRe, Typescript, OpenAI, Anthropic).
- Handled marketing, SEO, email deliverability, and analytics for a variety of projects. (AuditRe, SimpleHealth, NextJS).
- Automated devops tasks for a variety of projects, including CI/CD, monitoring, and scaling. (AuditRe, SimpleHealth, AWS-CDK, Ansible, Github Actions, etc).
- Designed, built, and maintained SimpleHealth's mobile app, an early adopter of ReactNative. (SimpleHealth, ReactNative, Flow).
- Architected and helped scale a browser-based web-crawler for indexing products from the web. This was one of the earliest (and at the time, largest) deployments of Docker in production. (Keep, Javascript, Python, Postgres, Redis, Docker).
