I&rsquo;m a software engineer and entrepreneur. I&rsquo;ve been building software for over 20 years and have been involved in a variety of projects and organizations, including co-founding three startups. With a background in computer science and design, my expertise lies at the intersection of technology and user experience.

Most recently I co-founded [AuditRe](https://auditre.co) in 2015, a platform for financial advisory service firms and their clients. Our premise is that audited financials could be delivered for review in a fraction of the cost and time. I architected and developed the system, leveraging applied-AI to automate many of the processes.

In 2015 I co-founded SimpleHealth, building a nation-wide healthcare business focused on providing telehealth services for reproductive health. My approach to technology is deeply rooted in a user-centric philosophy. At SimpleHealth, I leveraged this approach to develop a platform that simplified the complexity of healthcare interactions for patients and providers alike while retaining the ability for providers to deal with complex issues in an efficient manner.

In 2012 I joined Keep.com as a software engineer. Keep was a social shopping platform
that allowed users to save, share, and purchase products they loved. Throughout my
tenure I was part of front-end performance engineering, ops, and product crawling
teams. In 2013 I was promoted to lead engineering.

Throughout my career, I've worked strategically to build teams with capabilities beyond those of traditional cross-functional technology teams, fostering a culture of innovation and maintainability. Importantly I strove to pair the this with creating an environment where my teammates were able to learn and thrive.

## Technical contributions

- I created a testing framework for evaluating LLM models and optimizing prompts for usage within an organization/system (AuditRe, Typescript, OpenAI, Claude).
- Created tools for LLMs to reduce costs and improve performance and reliability (AuditRe, Typescript, OpenAI).
- Handled marketing, SEO, email deliverability, and analytics for a variety of projects. (AuditRe, SimpleHealth, NextJS).
- Automated devops tasks for a variety of projects, including CI/CD, monitoring, and scaling. (AuditRe, SimpleHealth, AWS-CDK, Ansible, Github Actions, etc).
- Designed, built, and maintained SimpleHealth's mobile app. (SimpleHealth, ReactNative, Flow).
- Architected and helped scale a browser-based web-crawler for indexing products from the web. This was one of the earliest (and at the time, largest) deployments of Docker in production. (Keep, Javascript, Python, Postgres, Redis, Docker).
